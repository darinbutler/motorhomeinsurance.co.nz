        <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Comprehensive motorhome cover costs more than third-party only, but the protection justifies the cost for most owners. Consider that a single claim for theft, fire, or weather damage could cost thousands. Even a small accident repair could exceed your annual premium. For motorhomes valued at $40,000+, comprehensive cover is almost always worth the investment.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          Motorhomes are frequently targeted for theft, especially high-value self-contained models and imported vehicles. Weather events can cause significant damage. Accidents happen to careful drivers. Comprehensive cover protects you against all these scenarios, ensuring you're not left facing thousands in out-of-pocket repairs.

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          Many comprehensive motorhome policies include excess-free or reduced-excess glass cover for windscreens, windows, and mirrors. This is valuable because glass damage is common (stone chips on highways, tree branches at campsites) and repair costs $200-500+ per incident. Excess-free glass means you can claim without paying excess, protecting your windscreen on the road.

        <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Third-party liability protection covers damage or injury your motorhome causes to others while you're driving. If you hit another car, damage a carpark structure, or cause injury to someone, third-party liability pays the costs up to your policy limit (typically $20 million). This is essential protection because you could face massive personal liability without it.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          In New Zealand, the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) handles personal injury claims, but property damage claims fall directly on you as the motorhome owner. Third-party liability ensures you're protected against these claims.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Liability Limits Explained</h3>

          Standard motorhome policies include third-party liability up to $20 million, which is very comprehensive. This covers almost any scenario you could face. In rare, catastrophic situations, claims could theoretically exceed $20 million, but these are extremely uncommon. The $20 million limit provides excellent protection for typical motorhoming situations.

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Why Agreed Value Matters for Motorhome Owners</h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Motorhomes depreciate significantly in their first few years. A motorhome purchased for $80,000 might be worth only $60,000 two years later due to wear, age, and market changes. With market value insurance, if it's written off, you'd receive $60,000, not your purchase price. With agreed value, you'd receive the $80,000 you agreed to, enabling proper replacement.

      </div>

      <div className="mb-8">
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">How Agreed Value Is Set</h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          At policy start, insurers conduct valuation based on: motorhome make/model/year, current market comparables, condition assessment (you may need a professional inspection), modifications or upgrades, and your proposed value. For new motorhomes, you use purchase price. For older motorhomes, get professional valuations from specialists familiar with that model.

          When you rent a motorhome, rental companies include basic insurance but with a significant excess. Standard excess ranges from $1,000 to $5,000, with $2,500 most common. This excess is your liability if the motorhome is damaged while renting. If you accidentally scrape a side, hit a tree, or damage interior appliances, you could face thousands in costs.

          Rental excess reduction insurance (also called rental decline insurance) covers your excess liability. You purchase this as a daily add-on ($10-20 per day typically).

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">How to Activate Lay-Up Cover</h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Contact your insurer before your storage period begins — not after. Request lay-up or storage-period cover explicitly and get written confirmation. Most specialist insurers (Covi, Star Insure) process this within 24-48 hours. When recommencing touring in spring, reinstate full comprehensive cover before taking the motorhome on the road. Never drive on lay-up cover — the driving component is removed and you would be uninsured for any road incident.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Home vs Facility Storage — Insurance Implications</h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          Dedicated storage facilities with 24/7 CCTV, gated access, and security patrols represent lower risk than home driveway storage. Some insurers offer 5-15% discounts for approved facility storage. Home garage storage is intermediate. Wherever you store, tell your insurer the accurate location — incorrect information can complicate claims. Secure storage is also good practice beyond insurance: GPS trackers, wheel clamps, and motion-activated lighting are worthwhile investments regardless of cover level.
