          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Is Comprehensive Cover Worth the Cost?</h3>
          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Comprehensive motorhome insurance costs more than third-party only, but for most owners the protection easily justifies the premium. Consider that a single theft claim, fire event, or significant collision repair could cost $10,000–$50,000 or more. Even a minor repair (windscreen replacement, panel damage from a campsite tree branch) can exceed $1,000. Against these risks, annual premiums of $900–$2,000 are modest.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            New Zealand motorhomes face specific risks that make comprehensive cover especially important: high-value imports targeted by organised theft rings, Freedom Camping locations in remote areas far from rescue services, and coastal conditions that accelerate corrosion and storm damage. Comprehensive cover addresses all of these scenarios and ensures you are never left facing a major financial loss alone.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Excess-Free Glass Cover — A Valuable Add-On</h3>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            Many comprehensive motorhome policies offer excess-free or reduced-excess glass cover for windscreens, windows, and mirrors. This is valuable because glass damage is among the most common motorhome insurance claims in New Zealand — stone chips from gravel roads, tree branches at campsites, and hail all cause frequent glass damage. Repair costs run $200–$600 per incident. Excess-free glass cover means you can repair chips and cracks without paying excess, keeping your windscreen clear and your no-claims bonus intact.

          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            New Zealand has no compulsory third-party property insurance, but the financial consequences of driving uninsured are severe. If your motorhome damages another vehicle, a commercial property, or public infrastructure — even in a minor incident — you are personally liable for all repair costs. A relatively modest accident involving a new car ($30,000–$80,000) or a commercial vehicle could result in a claim that threatens your personal finances for years.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            The $20 million third-party liability limit included in standard NZ motorhome policies provides comprehensive protection against even the most extreme scenarios. In practice, claims rarely reach more than a few hundred thousand dollars, but having the full $20 million limit costs nothing extra and provides complete peace of mind.

        <div className="mb-10">
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">How NZ Third-Party Liability Differs from Other Countries</h3>
          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            In New Zealand, ACC (Accident Compensation Corporation) handles personal injury claims from road accidents through a government-funded no-fault scheme. This means if your motorhome injures another person, they receive medical care and income support through ACC regardless of fault — and they cannot sue you for personal injury damages. This is a significant difference from many other countries.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            Your third-party liability insurance therefore only needs to cover property damage — not personal injury — which keeps NZ motorhome insurance premiums relatively affordable compared to countries without a universal accident compensation scheme.

          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Motorhome depreciation in New Zealand is significant. A motorhome purchased for $100,000 new may be worth $75,000 two years later and $55,000 four years after purchase, depending on the model, condition, and market demand. With market value insurance, a total loss after two years pays $75,000 — leaving a $25,000 gap from your original investment. With agreed value (set at purchase price of $100,000), you receive the full agreed amount regardless of when the claim occurs during the policy period.

          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            For the agreed value to protect you properly, it must accurately reflect your motorhome&apos;s true replacement cost. For new motorhomes, use the purchase price plus accessories and modifications. For used motorhomes, obtain a professional valuation from a specialist familiar with your make and model. NZMCA classifieds, TradeMe, and motorhome dealer valuations are all useful reference points. Ensure your agreed value is reviewed at each renewal — if motorhome market values have changed significantly, your agreed value should be updated accordingly.

          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            When a market value motorhome is written off or stolen, your insurer will assess its market value using New Zealand sales data at the time of the claim. This typically involves reviewing current TradeMe listings for comparable models, dealer valuations, industry price guides (such as Glass&apos;s Guide), and recent private sale records. The condition, mileage, service history, and regional demand for your specific model all influence the assessed value.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            If you believe the insurer&apos;s market value assessment is too low, you have the right to provide your own market evidence — comparable listings, independent valuations — and request a review. Disputes that cannot be resolved can be escalated to the Insurance and Financial Services Ombudsman (IFSO) at no cost to you.

Consider switching to agreed value if your motorhome appreciates in value — some European and premium models have increased in value in recent years.

            Many motorhome owners significantly underestimate the value of what they carry. A well-equipped NZ touring motorhome might contain: camping furniture and chairs ($500–$1,500), a portable BBQ and camp stove ($300–$800), GPS and navigation devices ($400–$1,200), a portable generator ($600–$3,000), an e-bike or two ($2,000–$8,000), cameras and electronics ($1,000–$5,000), clothing and personal items ($500–$2,000), and tools and maintenance supplies ($500–$1,500). Add it up and it is common to have $8,000–$20,000 worth of belongings aboard — all unprotected without contents cover.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Sub-Limits and High-Value Items</h3>
          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Contents policies typically have sub-limits (maximum payouts per item category). Electronics might be limited to $2,000 per item; bicycles to $1,500; jewellery to $1,000. If you carry items worth more than these sub-limits, you may need to schedule them separately — specifically listing them on your policy with an agreed value. Ask your insurer about sub-limits before purchasing contents cover, especially if you carry expensive cameras, laptops, or high-end e-bikes.

        <div className="mb-10">
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Permanently Fitted vs Portable — What Is Covered Where</h3>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            Permanently fitted fixtures in your motorhome — the fridge, cooker, built-in solar panels, inverter, water tanks, and cabinetry — are typically covered under your main motorhome insurance policy as part of the vehicle. Portable equipment that you can remove and use outside the motorhome falls under contents cover. The line can blur for items like slide-out awnings, external bike racks, and roof-mounted solar panels — confirm with your insurer how these are classified under your specific policy.

Read your policy wording carefully and if in doubt, purchase the rental company&apos;s own excess reduction product to ensure complete coverage.

            Standard car roadside assistance services are designed for passenger vehicles.

            Move to a safe location, activate hazard lights, and call your roadside assistance provider with your policy number, location, and vehicle description. In remote areas, use your phone&apos;s GPS to get coordinates. Response times in remote areas (Fiordland, Far North) can be 2–4 hours — carry water, food, and a blanket as standard preparation.

          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            A motorhome sitting in storage is not risk-free. Break-ins at home properties and storage facilities are common — motorhomes are high-value, visible targets. LPG and electrical systems present fire risk even when stationary. Storm damage to exposed motorhomes can cause thousands in repair costs. Rodent damage to wiring and upholstery is a genuine storage risk in many NZ regions. Cancelling insurance during storage creates a gap that one incident can make catastrophically expensive.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="mb-10">
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">How to Activate Lay-Up Cover</h3>
          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Contact your insurer before your storage period begins — not after. Request lay-up or storage-period cover explicitly and get written confirmation. Most specialist insurers (Covi, Star Insure) process this within 24–48 hours. When recommencing touring in spring, reinstate full comprehensive cover before taking the motorhome on the road. Never drive on lay-up cover — the driving component is removed and you would be uninsured for any road incident.

        <div className="mb-10">
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Home vs Facility Storage — Insurance Implications</h3>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            Dedicated storage facilities with 24/7 CCTV, gated access, and security patrols represent lower risk than home driveway storage. Some insurers offer 5–15% discounts for approved facility storage. Home garage storage is intermediate. Wherever you store, tell your insurer the accurate location — incorrect information can complicate claims. Secure storage is also good practice beyond insurance: GPS trackers, wheel clamps, and motion-activated lighting are worthwhile investments regardless of cover level.
