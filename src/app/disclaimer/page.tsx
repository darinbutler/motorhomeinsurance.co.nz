              This disclaimer contains important information about how MotorHomeInsurance.co.nz operates, our regulatory position, and the nature of the information we provide. By using our website you acknowledge you have read and understood this disclaimer.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-sky-600 mt-10 mb-4">1. We Are a Comparison &amp; Referral Service — Not an Insurer</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            MotorHomeInsurance.co.nz is operated by Cover4You, a New Zealand company. We are a no-fee comparison and referral service. We connect motorhome owners with licensed insurance brokers who can provide quotes and professional advice.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            We are not an insurance company, insurance broker, underwriter, or financial advice provider. We do not issue policies, handle claims, set premiums, or provide any form of personal insurance advice. All insurance products and advice are provided by the licensed brokers and insurers we refer you to.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-sky-600 mt-10 mb-4">2. Regulatory Position</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            MotorHomeInsurance.co.nz is not a regulated financial advice provider under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA). We do not provide personalised financial or insurance advice.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The licensed insurance brokers and advisers in our referral network hold Financial Advice Provider (FAP) licences issued by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) and are regulated under the FMCA. When a broker contacts you with a quote, you are receiving regulated financial advice from that licensed professional — not from us.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            All insurers featured on our website are members of the Insurance Council of New Zealand (ICNZ) and are bound by the ICNZ Code of Good Insurance Practice.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-sky-600 mt-10 mb-4">3. General Information Only — Not Personal Advice</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            All content published on MotorHomeInsurance.co.nz is general information only. It is provided to help you understand motorhome insurance and the options available, but it does not take into account your individual circumstances, needs, financial situation, or objectives.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            You should not rely on information on this website as the basis for any insurance decision. Before purchasing any insurance product:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 text-slate-700 mb-4">
            <li>Read the Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) provided by the insurer</li>
            <li>Ensure you understand what is and is not covered, including exclusions and conditions</li>
            <li>Discuss your specific coverage needs with your licensed broker</li>
            <li>Ask questions about anything you do not understand before committing</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-sky-600 mt-10 mb-4">4. Accuracy of Information</h2>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-sky-600 mt-10 mb-4">5. Commercial Relationships &amp; Independence</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            MotorHomeInsurance.co.nz may receive referral fees, commissions, or other commercial consideration from insurance brokers, underwriters, and providers featured on this website. These arrangements do not affect the price you pay for any insurance product.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Before featuring any provider on our website, we personally review and vet each broker, underwriter, and insurer to ensure they are appropriately licensed, hold good standing with relevant regulatory bodies (including ICNZ and the FMA), and meet our standards for claims handling and customer service.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            Our editorial content, comparisons, and assessments reflect our honest, independent assessment and are not influenced by commercial arrangements with providers.
